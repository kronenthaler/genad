programming guidelines:
1. Imports
    a. the order of the imports must be from basic utilities to refinated ones. By instance, 
	import java.io.*;
	import java.util.*;
	import java.awt.*;
	import java.awt.events.*;
	import javax.swing.*;
	  ...
    b. if (a) is tie, the packages belong to java go first, org and com come seconds, javax come third.
    c. if (b) doesn't break the tie, use length of the final package name, 
    d. if (c) still tie, use lexicographical order.
	e. the imports related to this project must be the last, separated by one blank line and sorted in
	the same way described in (a) to (d)

2. Names
	a. The name of the classes and methods follow the java standars or camel uppercase.
		- Classes begin with an upper case letter and for each new word this begins with an upper case letter too.
		- Methods begin with an lower case letter and for each new word this begins with an upper case letter.
		Examples: 
		class TableCellRenderer -> ok
		class Tablecellrenderer -> wrong
		class Table_Cell_Renderer -> wrong
		int methodForCalculateSomething() -> ok
		int methodforcalculateSomething() -> wrong
		int method_for_calculate_something() -> wrong
	b. This guideline includes any other code different than XSL, XML or CSS.
